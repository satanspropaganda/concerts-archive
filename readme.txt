The block to render my Concerts Archive block.

== Description ==

This plugin includes the custom post types & endpoints needed to place the Concerts Archive block in a site. It's far from complete and the styles aren't fully pruned down to just the ones needed for the plugin, but I thought I'd put it all in the plugin for ease.

Next steps wise I want to add more granular data & summaries to the single pages.
